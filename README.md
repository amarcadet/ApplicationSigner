# Application Signer

Application Signer allows you to (re) codesign any IPA files with the certificate of your choice.

This tool can be used to (re) codesign applications deployed inHouse for which the attached provisioning has expired.
You won't need to recompile the application, just re codesign it.
It's just 3 easy steps:

- Drag both IPA and Provisioning File into the application.
- Check if the selected certificate is the correct one.
- Drag the new IPA anywhere to save it.


## Requirements

- OS X Lion (10.7)
- Latest Xcode version available
